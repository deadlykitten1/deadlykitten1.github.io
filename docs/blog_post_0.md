# Why I chose to become a Data Scientist

I used to be a Software Engineer. I attended Middlebury College, a liberal arts school in Vermont, where I studied Computer Science and Film. I learned how to code in various languages, particularly Java and C.
I learned the Unix command line, and how computers work on a level as granular as transistors. My capstone project was a (bad) video game that my friend and I coded using C# scripts in the Unity engine. I graduated in May of 2019, and began working as a Software Engineer in August of that year.

I worked for a large government consulting firm called Booz Allen Hamilton. I had interned with them for two summers during school, and enjoyed both experiences very much. Unfortunately, my experience as a full time worker was not consistent with my internships. I felt isolated. I never felt part of a team the way I had as an intern. On top of this, I was frustrated with the job itself. My days were monotonous. I spent hours looking for inscrutable bugs. After two years and three projects, I decided it was time for a change.

I was living with my parents at the time. My lease in D.C. had expired a few months prior, but it had been almost a year since I moved back home as the pandemic disrupted all our lives. I devised an experiment to determine if my frustrations around work were because of my job as a Software Engineer, or were because of my place of work.

I had an idea for a video game in my mind, and so I embarked on a journey to design and develop a video game. Most importantly, I would see how tolerable software engineering is when I felt more connected to the overall mission of my work. So, for the following months, I developed my video game. I learned a new Java game development framework called LibGDX. I became a git and github expert. I wrote thousands of lines of code for hundreds of objects. But most importantly, I spent a lot of time outside of IntelliJ, designing game elements and mapping out my project development. I realized that I enjoyed the work outside of the coding, asking questions, and writing code as answers. 

I wanted to maintain my relevent skills in software development, but pivot away from pure coding. I feel as though Data Science is the perfect way to acheive this. It is the ideal blend between the technical and theoretical skills I possess. I am excited to learn more and apply myself in this field!
